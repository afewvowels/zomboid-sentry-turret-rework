# zomboid-sentry-turret-rework

Rework of the original Sentry Turret mod for Project Zomboid by WindFly

Removes ammo requirement, boosts radius of sound, and greatly increases fire rate and range. Also adds a corpse removal scan and sweep. Currently set to scan every 12 seconds and remove all corpses when the scan returns >800 corpses in a 20 tile square.

Also the turrets increment the player kill count on successful zombie kill.
